        <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>

        <p>In a world where the fate of empires hangs on the whims of a mere game, where kings and queens play with
            nothing more than their wits and their hands, there lies a most peculiar pastime - a game of chance and
            skill that can make or break even the mightiest of souls.

            It is a game known as Rock Paper Scissors - a game of strategy and deception, of cunning and guile, where
            one's fate is determined by nothing more than the flip of a wrist and the shape of a hand.

            Legend has it that the game was first played by the ancient gods, who sought a way to settle their eternal
            disputes without resorting to violence or bloodshed. And so they devised a game that would test their
            intellect and agility, their cunning and their wit.

            But little did they know that their creation would go on to become the bane of schoolyards and offices
            across the land, a game so addictive and so compelling that it has driven men to madness and women to tears.

            And yet, in the midst of this chaos and this madness, there are those who still cling to the hope that they
            might one day emerge victorious, that they might one day triumph over the odds and claim the title of Rock
            Paper Scissors Champion.
